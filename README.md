-   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
-   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux)
-   [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#install-cli)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    -   **Enable Authentication:** In your project's dashboard, go to *Build > Authentication > Sign-in method* and enable the **Email/Password** provider.
    -   **Enable Firestore:** Go to *Build > Firestore Database* and create a new database. Start in **Test mode** for easy setup.

3.  **Connect Your Flutter App to Firebase**
    -   Log in to Firebase using your terminal:
        ```bash
